            Like I said the first day of class, I got into making websites
             last year because I was annoyed with having to find a new 
             gaming website everytime one got blocked at school so I decided
             I would just make my own. My website actually got pretty popular
             and I had things on it such as game recommendations, school wide
             polls using google polls, and an escape hatch that would take you 
             to a school friendly website when you moused over it in case a 
             teacher was walking over to you.</p>
             <p>I actually did learn a lot about making websites on my own with 
                 the help of google but I was spending so much time on the website 
                 that I stopped paying attention in most of my classes. 
                 It is actually the reason I got my first D in a math class, which is weird 
                 for me because I've been in accelerated math since 3rd grade. 
             </p>
             <p>I decided that it was pretty obious to me how much I enjoyed making websites so 
                 I started looking into classes I could take on making websites to turn it 
                 into a job possibility. I actually tried to join the bootcamp before this one but I 
                 was too young because I didn't turn 18 until this past July, but now that I'm old enough 
                 I'm excited to learn.
